        <p>Akanksha Jharia, Riddhi Pankhade, Tanvi Takle and Shifa Biradar came together to bring this concept to life. This project has mainly consisted of two parts -- a research paper and the making of the algorithm. They worked under the guidance of thier mentor Dr. Sagar Dhanraj Pandey sir and successfully created an algorithm using the latest technologies of today to solve the problem affecting millions of women across the world.

            <p class = "akanksha"><a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/akanksha-jharia-7262b0329/" target="_blank">Akanksha Jharia</a> is the team leader of this group. Her contributions were overlooking the entire project and assigning tasks to the members. The research paper regarding this topic was also mainly written and structured by her along with the visual data.</p>

            <p class = "tanvi"><a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanvi-takle-0075772a2/" target = "_blank">Tanvi Takle</a> is a member of the group who contributed in both parts of this project. The successful implementation of the algorithm done by Ms.Riddhi and Ms.Shifa was the fruition of Ms.Tanvi's dedicated efforts in thorougly learning and immediately teaching them Object Detection algorithms. She made key contributions in the editing of the research paper as well.</p>

            <p class = "riddhi"><a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ridpankhade/" target = "_blank">Riddhi Pankhade</a> is a member of the group who gave invaluable contributions in classifying datasets, training the model as well as running it. She, with Ms. Shifa's diligent assistance, spend dozens of hours manually labelling each image dataset recieved from hybrid sources and augmenting the dataset to further increase the diversity of dataset. After which, she trained the model throught 25 epochs ___ times and finally ran some validation sets which finally proved to be a great success.</p>

            <p class = "shifa"><a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shifa-biradar-946490292/" target = "_blank">Shifa Biradar</a>'s assistance made it possible for the timely retrieval of image datasets of trans-vaginal cross-sectional ovary ultrasound scan images from hybrid sources. While Ms.Riddhi was focused on training and running the program, any background work needed to be done such as extra data augmentation, saving progress, running tests again, etc. was done due to Ms.Shifa's assitance.</p>

                <h2>Is It Really a Problem?</h2>
                <p>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a.k.a. PCOS is a a hormonal disorder that ideally occurs in women in their reproductive stage. It affects aroung 116 million women worldwide with an average of 276.4 cases per 1,00,000 people in Europe alone! And many of them even go undiagnosed.</p>
                <img src = "diag. vs. undiag..png"/>
            </div>
            <div class="stat2">
                <p>Being a problem in women's reproductive health, there is not much research on it. Resultantly it is neglected.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stat3">
                <p>It is also falsely diagnosed many times negatively affecting already healthy women with a normally functioning reproductive system.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stat4">
                <p>It can cause
                    <ul>
                        <li>diabetes</li>
                        <li>hyperplaxia</li>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>There are few but significant challenges as little research has been done.</p>
            <p><ol type = "I">
                <li>Difficult to obtain custome datasets due to patients not consenting to sharing their scans.</li>
                <li>Difficult to diagnose women in their menarcheal periods and menopausal periods</li>
            </ol></p>
        </div>

        <div class="impact">
            <h2>Impact in Medical Sectors</h2>
            <p>Our plan is to offer this program to hospitals locally and take their feedback for improvement. Being a one of its kind, we offer an immediate PCOS diagnosis like never before increasing its market value significantly.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, providing our program to established hospitals at a fair price will also lead to more efforts in research for its treatment as diagnosis will be instantaneous and more time will be dedicated to curing the patients.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="future">
            <h2>Future Scope</h2>
            <p>According to the <a href = "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8409808/" target = "_blank">Rotterdam Criteria</a>, there are three conditions one must meet to solidify the diagnosis of PCOS. You must meet at least 2 out of these 3 conditions.They are: <ul style = "list-style-type: circle;" >
                <li>Oligo/Amenorrhea</li>
                <li>Androgen excess</li>
                <li>Polycystic Ovarian Morphology</li>
            </ul>We will add two more algorithms to help diagnose these two criteria as well. Although a blood test is the current method to diagnose androgen excess, we aim to conveniently check all three conditions and have all information in one application for the convenience of medical experts and/or consultants.</p>

            <p>An additional feature will also be provided where doctors(with the consent of the patient) can document the records of PCOS positive patients and send them to medical institutions to be further researched upon.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Hope we have you convinced now.</p>
